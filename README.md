# IhomeAngular

This is the front end for a farm management app. I am a Software Engineering student at Makerere University and a passionate goat farmer.  
After experiencing problems resulting from poor record-keeping on the farm, I decided to start this project to help farmers keep track of their farm activities and make informed decisions based on the data collected.
